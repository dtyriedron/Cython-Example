# cythonexample
Trying out cython and testing the speed compared to the same code done in python.

- In testing.py two compilation times are compared based on two different file types .py and .pyx and then the difference between the two files are printed.
- The difference between the files example_cy.pyx and example_py.py are timed.
- The results from the testing.py file are shown in the testResults.txt file.
- C and C++ files are also created as bi-product allowing for python to be used to speed up development of such languages.
- The html file can be viewed in a browser to allow people to see the translation to C from python on each line of the code.
